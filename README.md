# MachineLearning-Coursework
This repo contains some python scripts that were useful during the coursework for the Machine Learning course at the University of Glasgow. Course taken in the 2017-2018 academic year.

Scripts require training and testing data from files called X_train.csv, X_test.csv, Y_train.csv and Y_test.csv. However, these datasets (csv files) cannot be shared due to a request from the course coordinator. 
Nevertheless, these scripts were useful to get a feel for performing analysis on the coursework data and for performing some basic regression and classification on the data.
